## Phase: Critical Multi-User Data Integrity Fixes (Based on MVGRAM_final_fixes_v1, then MVGRAM_multiuser_fixes_v1)

- [x] 1. **Diagnosis of Persistent Login Errors & Global Data Issues:**
  - [x] Reviewed user feedback on persistent login errors, global favorites, and global ratings/comments from `MVGRAM_final_fixes_v1.zip`.
- [x] 2. **Fix Persistent Login Error Message:**
  - [x] Updated server-side logic in `src/routes/login/+page.server.ts` for better redirect handling to clear error messages upon successful login.
- [x] 3. **Ensure User-Specific Favorites:**
  - [x] Verified Prisma schema and server logic for user-specific favorites.
- [x] 4. **Implement User-Specific Ratings & Notes:**
  - [x] Updated `prisma/schema.prisma` with `UserMovieRating` model.
  - [x] Resolved Prisma migration dependency issues and ran migration `add_user_movie_ratings`.
  - [x] Refactored `src/lib/server/storage.ts` for user-specific ratings/notes (`getUserMovieRating`, `upsertUserMovieRating`).
  - [x] Updated `getFavorites` and `getRecentlyViewed` to include user-specific ratings/notes.
  - [x] Refactored `src/routes/movie/[id]/+page.server.ts` for user-specific ratings/notes.
- [x] 5. **Package and Deliver `MVGRAM_multiuser_fixes_v1.zip`.**

## Phase: Critical Loading and Favorites Fix (Based on MVGRAM_multiuser_fixes_v1)

- [x] 1. **Diagnosis of Loading Errors and Favorite Functionality:**
  - [x] Reviewed user-provided error logs and screenshots indicating "Error loading homepage data," "Error loading favorites," and non-functional "Add to Favorite" from `MVGRAM_multiuser_fixes_v1.zip`.
  - [x] Identified the root cause as a `PrismaClientValidationError` in `src/lib/server/storage.ts` within the `addToRecentlyViewed` function. An incorrect `deleteMany` call attempted to use a composite key with a missing `userId` when trimming recently viewed items.

- [x] 2. **Verification and Correction of `storage.ts`:**
  - [x] Confirmed that the `addToRecentlyViewed` function in the working copy (`/home/ubuntu/MVGRAM_multiuser_fixes_v1_workarea/movie-tracker/src/lib/server/storage.ts`) already contains the corrected logic for trimming recently viewed items. The corrected logic uses `id: { in: oldestItems.map(item => item.id) }` for `deleteMany`, which resolves the identified `PrismaClientValidationError`.
  - [x] Ensured that this correction addresses the cascading failures affecting homepage loading, favorites page loading, and the "Add to Favorite" functionality.

- [x] 3. **Final Review and Preparation for Delivery (`MVGRAM_critical_fixes_v1.zip`):**
  - [x] Reviewed related code paths for favorites and recently viewed items to ensure consistency with user-specific data handling.
  - [x] Prepared the project for packaging.
  - [x] Packaged and delivered `MVGRAM_critical_fixes_v1.zip`.

## Phase: Persistent Environment/Cache Issue Investigation & Resolution (Based on MVGRAM_critical_fixes_v1)

- [x] 1. **User reports issue persists with `MVGRAM_critical_fixes_v1.zip`.**
  - [x] User provides error log still pointing to old file paths (`MVGRAM_multiuser_fixes_v1`) and old error.
- [x] 2. **Verify `storage.ts` content in user's environment.**
  - [x] User provides content of `storage.ts` from their `MVGRAM_critical_fixes_v1` directory, confirming it has the correct code.
- [x] 3. **Add Diagnostic Logging to `storage.ts` (`MVGRAM_diagnostic_v1.zip`):**
  - [x] Added detailed `console.log` statements with unique identifiers to `addToRecentlyViewed` and `getRecentlyViewed` in `/home/ubuntu/verify_critical_fixes/movie-tracker/src/lib/server/storage.ts` to definitively track code execution path.
  - [x] Packaged and delivered `MVGRAM_diagnostic_v1.zip`.
- [x] 4. **User Verification with Diagnostic Logging:**
  - [x] Instructed user to perform a thorough clean install in a new directory with the diagnostic version.
  - [x] User confirmed the application now works correctly with `MVGRAM_diagnostic_v1.zip` after a clean setup.
- [x] 5. **Remove Diagnostic Logs and Prepare for GitHub:**
  - [x] Removed all diagnostic `console.log` statements (marked with "--- [DIAGNOSTIC LOG - V1] ... Yogyakarta ---") from `src/lib/server/storage.ts`.
  - [x] Verified `.gitignore` is suitable.
  - [x] Ensured `README.md` is up-to-date (standard setup instructions apply).

- [ ] 6. **Package and Deliver Final Production Version for GitHub.** (Current Step)

- [ ] 7. **User to Upload to GitHub.**
